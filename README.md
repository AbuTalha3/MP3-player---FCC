# MP3 Player - FCC Project
This project is designed to help you learn essential string and array methods in JavaScript, such as find(), forEach(), map(), and join(), which are crucial for developing dynamic web applications. You'll be building a basic MP3 player using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Getting Started
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Open the project directory in your preferred code editor.
Modify the index.html, styles.css, and script.js files to implement your MP3 player functionality.
Project Structure
index.html: This file contains the structure of your MP3 player interface. You'll define the layout, buttons, playlist, and other elements here.
styles.css: The CSS file where you can style your HTML elements, including fonts, colors, layouts, and player controls.
script.js: This is where you'll write your JavaScript code to handle MP3 player functionality, such as playing songs, pausing, skipping tracks, displaying the playlist, and managing audio controls.
# MP3 Player Features
Your MP3 player may include the following features:

# Playlist Management: 
Load and display a list of MP3 files to create a playlist.
Audio Controls: Implement play, pause, stop, volume control, and track progress functionalities.
Track Navigation: Allow users to skip to the next or previous track in the playlist.
Dynamic UI Updates: Update the UI to show the currently playing track, track duration, and progress bar.
Responsive Design: Ensure your MP3 player is responsive and works well across different screen sizes.
How to Use
Open the index.html file in your web browser to launch the MP3 player.
Use the player controls (play, pause, stop, volume slider, track navigation) to interact with the audio tracks.
Click on tracks in the playlist to select and play them.
Explore additional features you've implemented, such as track progress display and dynamic UI updates.
